                I am a Web Developer.I had a great interest in
                React web development from my childhood.I always
                wondered how these web pages work. A passionate programmer
                and a Learner, born and brought up in Bangladesh. I am a
                Web Developer with <strong>React.js, Redux, Express.js,
                  JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB as my tech stack.</strong>


                Working with the clients, my goal is always
                driven towards providing amazing experience
                with the best level of quality and service to them.

                Along with that, I also help people as a COACH
                on their journey of becoming a professional programmer.
                I love learning about new technologies,
                what problems are they solving and How can I use
                them to build better and scalable products.
